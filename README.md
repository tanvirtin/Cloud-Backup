# Google-Drive-File-System-Synchronization-with-Ubuntu

# Context:

Google Drive is a file storage and synchronization service developed by Google [1]. It allows users to store files in the cloud, synchronize them across devices, and share them. In addition to a website, it offers apps which automatically synchronize with Windows and Mac OS computers, as well as Android and iOS smartphones and tablets.
As one of the biggest companies in the world, Google’s platform is more secure (By secure we are referring to API secure), and more efficient than its lesser known counterparts.  Until now, the Google Drive app feature was only accessible to Windows and Mac OS users—but not to Linux Ubuntu users; the purpose of this project is to integrate it with Linux Ubuntu’s file system.
